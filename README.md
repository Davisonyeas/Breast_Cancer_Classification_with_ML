# Breast_Cancer_Classification_with_ML
Machine Learning models that classify patients as either benign or malignant

# Introduction
Breast cancer is a type of cancer that is found in the tissues of the breast. It is mostly common among women. In 2020, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer. Early diagnosis of women with breast cancer symptoms is recommended as it could increase chances of survival. However, the aim of this project is to classify women as either benign group, or malignant group, using Machine Learning Model.
